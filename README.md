# Weather-Dashboard

User Story Motivation: 
This webpage was created to help plan for trips taken to multiple cities in advance.

Webpage function:
Users can search for the weather, humidity, wind speed, and uv index by using the search bar to look up current data, and data for the following five days. All of this information has been pulled from the open weather API. Previous searchs can also be saved in a list, so they can be easily viewed again, and this list can be cleared.
